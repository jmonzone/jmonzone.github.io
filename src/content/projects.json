            "7 Wonder is a board game where players must calculate their points based on the combination of cards they have collected. The calculation can be tricky to do with a lot of cards, so this calculator was built to make it easier.",
            "This calculator uses image recognition to detect the type of card and places an indicator in augmented reality to show that it has been detected. The project was built as an iOS application using ARKit and SwiftUI."
